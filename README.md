Welcome to my GitHub corner of the internet! Here's a bit about me:

## About Me

## What I'm Up To

I'm diving deep into the world of web development, soaking up knowledge from an amazing teacher on youtube called "Tech with Nader." üß†

- Recently finished: **Javascript in Depth**
- Currently studying: [**DOM in Depth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMPC6q7HIuQ&list=PLovN13bqAx7ALeYQ-h4lhxa8PymM2b79L&index=1)

## Fun Fact

A few years ago, I achieved my bachelor's degree in **Multimedia & Communication Technology**. I found myself more drawn to motion design back then.
Fast forward 6 years, and here I am, rekindling my passion for programming. Life has a funny way of coming full circle, doesn't it?
